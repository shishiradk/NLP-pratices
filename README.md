# SMS Spam/Ham Classification Using Bag of Words and TF-IDF

This project demonstrates how to build a text classification model to identify SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam) using traditional NLP techniques — Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF — combined with machine learning algorithms.

---

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify SMS messages into spam or ham categories to filter unwanted messages.
- **Techniques:**  
  - Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization)  
  - Feature extraction using Bag of Words and TF-IDF  
  - Model training and evaluation with classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or others
- **Dataset:** Publicly available SMS Spam Collection dataset

## Key Steps

1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Clean and preprocess the text messages  
3. Convert text into numerical features using BoW and TF-IDF  
4. Train ML classifiers on the extracted features  
5. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
6. Compare BoW vs TF-IDF approaches

## Results & Insights

- The model successfully distinguishes spam from ham messages with high accuracy.
- TF-IDF features generally perform better than simple Bag of Words.
- This project provides a foundation for understanding classic NLP text classification workflows.
